                <h1>FullStack</h1>
                <p> Full-stack development refers to the practice of working on both the front end and back end of a web application or software system. A full-stack developer is proficient in both the client-side and server-side technologies, allowing them to handle all aspects of application development.

<br><br>On the front end, full-stack developers work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface and design. They utilize frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js to build interactive and responsive web pages. They also handle the integration of various APIs and services, ensuring seamless communication between the front end and the back end.

<br><br>On the back end, full-stack developers work with server-side programming languages like Python, Java, or Node.js. They handle server-side logic, database management, and web server configuration. They work with frameworks like Django, Flask, Spring, or Express.js to build the application's core functionality, handle user authentication, manage data storage, and implement security measures.

<br><br>Full-stack developers are proficient in working with databases, both relational (such as MySQL or PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (such as MongoDB or Cassandra). They understand how to design database schemas, write efficient queries, and ensure data integrity.

<br><br>Additionally, full-stack developers have knowledge of version control systems like Git, which allows them to collaborate with other developers and manage code changes effectively. They also possess skills in deployment and infrastructure management, enabling them to deploy applications to various hosting platforms, set up servers, and configure cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

<br><br>Being a full-stack developer requires a versatile skill set and the ability to adapt to different technologies and frameworks. They are capable of handling all stages of the software development lifecycle, from conceptualizing and designing the application to developing, testing, and deploying it.</p>
